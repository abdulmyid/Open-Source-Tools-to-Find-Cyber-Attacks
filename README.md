Open Source Tools to Find Cyber Attacks
Open source tools offer a powerful and cost-effective way to enhance your cybersecurity posture. Here's a mapping of some popular open source tools categorized by their function in detecting and investigating cyber attacks:

1. Network Security Monitoring:

Suricata: A powerful network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) that inspects network traffic in real-time, looking for malicious patterns and known threats.

Use case: Detecting malware, intrusions, and suspicious network activity.

Zeek (formerly Bro): A network security monitor that provides deep insight into network traffic, generating logs and alerts for unusual activity.

Use case: Analyzing network traffic for anomalies, identifying botnet activity, and detecting data exfiltration attempts.

Security Onion: A Linux distribution specifically designed for network security monitoring, combining tools like Suricata, Zeek, and Elasticsearch for comprehensive analysis.

Use case: Setting up a complete network security monitoring environment for threat detection and incident response.

Snort: Another popular open source IDS/IPS that analyzes network traffic against a set of rules to identify malicious activity.

Use case: Detecting known attacks, port scans, and other suspicious network behavior.

2. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):

OSSEC: A Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) that monitors system logs, file integrity, and system processes for signs of compromise.

Use case: Detecting malware infections, rootkits, and unauthorized changes to system files.

Wazuh: An open source security platform that combines HIDS, SIEM, and vulnerability detection capabilities, providing comprehensive endpoint security.

Use case: Monitoring endpoints for threats, analyzing logs, and managing vulnerabilities.

TheHive: A scalable Security Incident Response Platform (SIRP) for managing security incidents and investigations.

Use case: Organizing and collaborating on incident response activities, tracking investigations, and storing evidence.

3. Log Management and Analysis:

Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK Stack): A powerful combination for collecting, processing, and visualizing log data from various sources.

Use case: Centralized log management, real-time analysis of security events, and creating dashboards for threat monitoring.

Graylog: Another open source log management platform that can collect, analyze, and visualize logs from a wide range of systems.

Use case: Analyzing logs for security incidents, identifying patterns, and creating alerts for suspicious activity.

4. Vulnerability Scanning:

OpenVAS: A comprehensive vulnerability scanner that can identify security weaknesses in your systems and applications.

Use case: Conducting regular vulnerability assessments, identifying potential attack vectors, and prioritizing patching efforts.

Nmap: A powerful network scanner that can discover hosts, services, and vulnerabilities on a network.

Use case: Mapping your network, identifying open ports, and detecting potential security risks.

5. Malware Analysis:

ClamAV: An open source antivirus engine that can detect and remove malware from files and email attachments.

Use case: Basic malware protection for endpoints and email servers.

VirusTotal: A free online service that allows you to scan files and URLs against multiple antivirus engines.

Use case: Checking the reputation of files and URLs, identifying potential malware.

6. Forensics:

Autopsy: A digital forensics platform that can analyze hard drives and other storage media for evidence of cyber attacks.

Use case: Investigating security incidents, recovering deleted files, and analyzing malware infections.

The Sleuth Kit: A collection of command-line tools for digital forensics investigations.

Use case: Analyzing disk images, recovering files, and conducting in-depth forensic analysis.

7. Dark Web Monitoring:

SpiderFoot: An open source intelligence (OSINT) automation tool that can gather information from various sources, including the dark web.

Use case: Monitoring the dark web for mentions of your organization, identifying leaked credentials, and detecting potential threats.

8. Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR):

TheHive and Cortex: These tools can be integrated to automate security incident response workflows. TheHive acts as the SIRP, while Cortex provides automated analysis and response capabilities.

Use case: Automating incident handling tasks, enriching alerts with threat intelligence, and streamlining incident response processes.

Key Considerations:

Expertise: Open source tools often require a higher level of technical expertise to deploy and manage effectively.

Community Support: Relying on community forums and documentation for support.

Integration: Ensuring compatibility and smooth integration with your existing security infrastructure.

By leveraging a combination of these open source tools, organizations can significantly improve their ability to detect, investigate, and respond to cyber attacks, even with limited budgets. Remember to tailor your tool selection to your specific needs and security environment.
